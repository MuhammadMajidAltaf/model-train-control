ECE 4534 Model Train Control Spartan-3E/Microblaze Code

Most of this code was written by me, but much of the utility stuff was provided
as a starting point by the course instructors. However, I also modified most of
that. Therefore, anything that looks cool or ingenious was my doing (e.g. the
sweet union-based I2C message objects), and anything sketchy or non-robust was
obviously not.

The code worked well at the project's conclusion in May 2011, however it would
require a specific Xilinx BSP to compile and use. So it is only provided for
historical documentation purposes, and no warranty is provided, express or
implied, in terms of merchantability or fitness for any purpose.
